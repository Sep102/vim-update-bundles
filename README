Use Pathogen and Git to manage all your Vim plugins.


DESCRIPTION

This script maintains your vim plugins.  It reads BUNDLE: directives
from your .vimrc, then updates the .vim/bundle directory to match.
For example, to load NERDTree, add this line to your .vimrc:

    " BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git


INSTALL

NOTE: If you currently use vim, it's best to move your ~/.vim directory
and ~/.vimrc file out of the way and start fresh.

  $ wget http://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles/raw/master/vim-update-bundles
  $ ruby vim-update-bundles

Now you have a working barebones install.  Open ~/.vimrc, enable a few
plugins (remove the leading #), and run the script again.  You can install
any git url, for instance one from http://github.com/vim-scripts


USAGE

From within Vim, run ':help bundles' to list all the bundles you have
installed, along with hotlinks to their help pages.

Run vim-update-bundles whenever you want to ensure your plugins, syntax
files, and color schemes are all up to date.


VIMRC

Any line of the format '" BUNDLE: URL [REV]' will be interpreted as a
bundle to download.  URL is a git repository url, and REV is an optional
git refspec that allows you to lock the plugin at a particular tag, branch
or sha1.

    " BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git 4.0.0

This ensures your NerdTree remains at version 4.0.0.  If NerdTree releases
a new version, just bump the version number and re-run vim-update-bundles.
If you don't specify a branch, tag, or sha1, vim-update-bundles checks out
the master branch.


BUNDLES.TXT

From within Vim, type ':help bundles' to show a list of the bundes you
have installed.  vim-update-bundles produces this file every time it runs.
