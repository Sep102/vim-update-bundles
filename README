Use Pathogen and Git to manage your Vim plugins.


DESCRIPTION

This script reads comments in your vimrc to determine which plugins you want to
use, then updates the .vim/bundle directory to match.  For example, this
snippet brings in the latest version of scrooloose's nerdtree, then binds
\d to open and close it:

    " --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
    nmap <leader>d :NERDTreeToggle<cr>

Any time you modify the plugins listed in your .vimrc, running
vim-update-bundles will ensure your plugins, syntax files, and color schemes
will all be kept up to date.


INSTALL

1. Install Pathogen (copy pathogen.vim into ~/.vim/autoload).
   http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

2. Name your plugins with lines like:
      " --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/bronson/vim-closebuffer.git
   in your ~/.vimrc.  See the examples included in this repo for more.

3. $ git clone http://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles
   $ cd vim-update-bundles
   $ ./vim-update-bundles

4. Now all your bundles are up to date!  Hit :help bundles to see them.


YOUR VIMRC

Any line of the format '" --- BUNDLE: URL [REV]' will be interpreted as a
bundle to download.  URL is a git repository url, and REV is an optional
refspec that allows you to lock the plugin at a particular tag, branch or sha1.

    " --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git 4.0.0

This will ensure your NerdTree remains at version 4.0.0.  If NerdTree releases
a new version, just bump the version number and re-run vim-update-bundles.  If
you don't specify a branch, tag, or sha1, vim-update-bundles checks out the
master branch.

If you remove a bundle from your vimrc, vim-update-bundles will delete it from
~/.vim/bundles.  Be careful!


BUNDLES.TXT

When it runs, vim-update-bundles produces a list of the bundles downloaded in
doc/bundles.txt.  It also lists version numbers (via 'git describe') and the
date of the last commit.  In Vim, hit ':help bundles' to see the bundles you
have installed.

HISTORY

This script came from Tammer Saleh's blog post in March 2010:
  http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen

It grew for a while in Vimsy (a full set of Vim dotfiles and plugins) before
being released on its own on 11 Aug 2010.
