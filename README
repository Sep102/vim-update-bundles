vim-update-bundles

Use Pathogen and Git to manage your Vim plugins.


DESCRIPTION

This script reads comments in your vimrc to determine which plugins you want to
use, then updates your .vim/bundle directory to match.  For example, this tells
git-update-bundles to install the latest version of scrooloose's nerdtree:

    " --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
    nmap <leader>d :NERDTreeToggle<cr>
    nmap <leader>D :NERDTreeFind<cr>

Any time you modify the plugins listed in your .vimrc, run vim-update-bundles
and your plugins, syntax files, and color schemes will all be updated.


INSTALL

1. Install Pathogen (copy pathogen.vim into ~/.vim/autoload).
   http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

2. Name your plugins with lines like:
      " --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/bronson/vim-closebuffer.git
   in your ~/.vimrc.  See the examples included in this repo for more.

3. $ git clone http://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles
   $ cd vim-update-bundles
   $ ./vim-update-bundles

4. Now all your bundles are up to date.  What will you do with all your time
   now that you don't need to spend it manually updating vim plugins?


YOUR VIMRC

Any line of the format '" --- BUNDLE: URL [REV]' will be interpreted as a
bundle to download.  URL is a git repository url, and REV is an optional
refspec that allows you to lock the plugin at a particular tag, branch or sha1.

    " --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git 4.0.0

This will ensure your NerdTree remains at version 4.0.0.  If NerdTree releases
a new version, just bump the version number and re-run vim-update-bundles.  If
you don't specify a branch, tag, or sha1, vim-update-bundles checks out the
master branch.

If you remove a bundle from your vimrc, vim-update-bundles will delete it from
~/.vim/bundles.  Be careful!


BUNDLES.TXT

When it runs, vim-update-bundles produces a list of the bundles downloaded in
doc/bundles.txt.  It also lists version numbers (via 'git describe') and the
date of the last commit.  In Vim, hit ':help bundles' to see the bundles you
have installed.


HISTORY

This script came from Tammer Saleh's blog post in March 2010:
  http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen

It grew for a while in Vimsy (a full set of Vim dotfiles and plugins) before
being released on its own on 11 Aug 2010.
