- submodule support?
- added a configuration file?


- Added verbose flag.  ./vim-update-bundles verbose=1 to hear everything.
- Don't clean ".vim" from repo names.  a.vim is no longer called "a".
- bugfix: repos now automatically fast-forward to the latest commit.
- added command line args: ./vim-update-bundles vimrc="$HOME/dots/vimrc"
  but they're not very useful in real life, only for testing.
- added some tests!  "rake test" in the git repo to run them.
- created a changes file.
