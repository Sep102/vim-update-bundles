" vim-update-bundles example .vimrc
"
" This is not a good vimrc to use because it's incomplete.
" It just illustrates " how to call Pathogen, load some plugins:
" nerdtree, nerdcommenter, surround, etc.  For a real-world
" example, see http://github.com/bronson/vimsy/blob/master/vimrc


" Let Pathogen bring in all the plugins
filetype off
call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()

filetype indent plugin on
syntax on


set nocompatible      " tends to make things work better
set incsearch         " find the next match as we type the search
set hlsearch          " hilight searches by default
" ... etc.


"        load the nerdtree plugin:
" --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
"        and configure it to open using \d and \D
nmap <leader>d :NERDTreeToggle<cr>
nmap <leader>D :NERDTreeFind<cr>


" --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter.git
" add a space between the comment delimiter and text
let NERDSpaceDelims=1


" --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/tpope/vim-surround.git
" tell surround not to break the visual s keystroke (:help vs)
xmap S <Plug>Vsurround


" --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/bronson/vim-taglist.git
nmap <leader>l :TlistToggle<cr>


" --- BUNDLE: git://github.com/bronson/vim-bufexplorer.git
